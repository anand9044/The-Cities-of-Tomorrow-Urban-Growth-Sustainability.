🌆 Cities of Tomorrow – Urban Growth & Sustainability
Fabric Data Days Notebook Challenge | November 2025

This project explores how cities evolve, sustain, and innovate for a more livable future using data-driven insights. With rapid urbanization worldwide, understanding the balance between growth, environment, and livability has never been more important.

Using the Sustainable Urban Planning & Landscape dataset (Kaggle), this notebook analyzes key sustainability indicators across global cities.

📊 Project Highlights

✅ Data Cleaning & Preparation
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✅ Sustainability Indicator Insights
✅ Feature Engineering
✅ Clustering (Sustainability Maturity Groups)
✅ Visual Storytelling & Interpretation
✅ Policy & Planning Recommendations

🧾 Dataset

Primary Dataset:
Sustainable Urban Planning & Landscape Dataset – Kaggle

Key Attributes:

Green Area Percentage (%)

Urban Density

Transport Infrastructure Score

Renewable Energy Index

Pollution Index

Livability Index

Optional External Sources:

World Bank Urban Development Indicators

🔍 Key Insights

Cities with higher green area coverage tend to show lower pollution levels

Renewable energy adoption strongly correlates with livability improvements

Some high-density cities successfully maintain sustainability through:

efficient transport systems

renewable energy investment

urban planning strategies

🧠 Feature Engineering

Created new indicators for deeper insight:

Green-to-Density Ratio

Sustainable Mobility Index

Composite Sustainability Score (optional)

These help quantify sustainability performance beyond single metrics.

🤖 Modeling (Optional)

Applied K-Means Clustering to group cities into sustainability maturity categories:

Sustainable Leaders

Growing but Strained

Emerging / At Risk

📈 Visualizations Include

KPI Summary Cards

Green Area Trend Over Time

Urban Density Comparison by City

Renewable Energy vs Total Energy Usage

Pollution Trend Analysis

City Ranking Visuals

Cluster Visualization (optional)

🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data science can help:

identify sustainability strengths and weaknesses

guide urban policy decisions

support the vision of smarter, greener, more livable cities
